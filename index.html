        <h2>First Mile</h2>
        <h2>Why did you choose to study Software Engineering?</h2>
        <p>I chose to study software engineering in order to upskill and keep up to date with the evolution of tech. Software skills are applicable across many different industries, and I believe it will become a favourable skill regardless of career type.</p>

        <h2>Phase 0 Project - Personal Website</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What went well? Key learning.</li>
            <li>What could have been improved?</li>
            <li>The key take aways.</li>
            <li>The process you followed?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>It was good to apply introductory knowledge to a personal project for the first time. Given the freedom to be able to design and implement anything drew in creative skills above the technical skills of HTML and CSS. One of the key learnings that I took away from this experience was utilising online resources to help me with problems on the fly. Anytime I forgot how to implement something, google was simply a click away which made the whole process a good learning activity.</p>
        <p>Overall, I think with the knowledge I have now, I still do not know how to build something from scratch with the full freedom of what I want. My skillset at the moment is limited, so I feel like I am still building with a limited mindset. Continuing to further improve my HTML and CSS skills overtime will definitely help eliminate the barriers of building.</p>
        <p>The key take aways from this project is to use online resources, make small but consistent changes and to build a pretermined design in your head before starting technical building.</p>
        <p>I followed the advice of building the project in a systematic way, and utilising the git commit function to push updates at a slow pace. This helped keep track of all the little changes I was making, and helped reflect where I left of when I returned to the project. I started by building the format of the project, which included dividing all the elements in HTML into a layout I wanted. Then I slowly added the content required throughout the document, which kept me focused on the HTML aspect of the project. Once all my content was complete, I moved on to developing the visual aspect via CSS until I was happy with the project. Finally, I checked my code in the online verification and added small changes throughout the document before wrapping up and uploading.</p>
